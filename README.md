## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Web3-based payment system, akin to PayPal, but leveraging Ethereum blockchain technology. It highlights interactions with a smart contract for handling payment requests and tracking transaction history.

## Features

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
- Truffle Suite for smart contract deployment.
- Ganache for a personal Ethereum blockchain.
- MetaMask extension for browser integration.

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start Ganache and deploy the smart contract with Truffle.
4. Configure MetaMask to connect to the Ganache instance.
5. Run the application with `npm start`.
